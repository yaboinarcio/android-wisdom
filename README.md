# Narcio's ultimate wisdom for Android pimpin n strippin
and other FOSS / Mod extravaganza. Compiled by a complete idiot.

## Why are you doing this, Narcio?
Because someone asked me to do so, and I, stupid but magnanimous being, granted his wish.

## How can I contribute to this thing?
If you feel like adding new entries to this list write to email-placeholder. If you got the spandooli to spare, each creator has its own donation method. Big corps don't deserve the money they have. Neither do I for writing this bullshit.
